## hello! #

I'm Daniel â€” I'm an ML Compiler Engineer and hobbyist writer/interviewer. I co-run a publication called _The Gradient_ which consists of an [online magazine](https://thegradient.pub/), a newsletter, and a podcast where I [interview people about things that are increasingly not AI](https://thegradientpub.substack.com/s/podcast). I write a personal blog about music, literature, and my ever-present state of confusion called ["Sincerely, In Jest"](https://thejester.substack.com/).
